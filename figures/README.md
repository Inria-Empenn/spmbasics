# FIGURES
This folder contains three sub folders of the figures of the SPM block desing FMRI preprocessing. Each subfolder is named after SPM processing interfaces.
* GUI refers to clicking the interface one by one, saving the results step by step and moving the next step as described in the tutorial.
* BATCH refers to the batch interface, which performs exactly same steps with GUI but with dependencies to previous step and runs at once.
* SCRIPT refers to the scripting result of the same preprocessing steps from Matlab.
* FIRST_LEVEL refers to the first level analysis results of the block design.
* Event_Related contains resulting figures from event related design
