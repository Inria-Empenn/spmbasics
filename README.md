## Overview

This repo contains my reproduction of the SPM12 tutorials with MATLAB. 
You can find the code in [src](https://github.com/mselimata/spmbasics/tree/main/src) folder.


Version of the software used:```MATLAB R2020b``` & ```SPM12```.


 
 ## How to Reproduce Each Step
 TODO - add details and links
Follow the guideline below for each process:
